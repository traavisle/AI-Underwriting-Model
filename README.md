# AI-Underwriting-Model
This project is a machine learning based underwriting model designed to help mortgage lenders assess loan applications more efficiently. It analyzes key financial data such as income, credit history, and assets to predict the likelihood of loan defaults, making the underwriting process instant.

Being in the field of loaning already, I wanted to incorporate a project around it. As I am growing my mortgage brokerage business, I want to include eventually build my own software to allow underwriters/loan officers ease with this service. 

I've trained this model a few times and plan on continuing to train it more as time goes on and turn it into its own SaaS after I feel like the model is well trained enough.

Currently it can:
-Clean and process loan application data
-Trains multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
-Evaluates model accuracy and performance
-Helps identify risk factors in loan approvals

How to Use:
Make sure a csv is in the project folder.
Run loan_underwriting.py to train and test the model.
Check the output for accuracy scores and model performance.

Next Steps:
-Improve predictions with more examples of real-world lending data
-Add fraud detection features
-Develop a full SaaS platform for mortgage lenders
-This is an ongoing project aimed at making loan underwriting smarter, faster, and more reliable.
